# Interactive Physics Simulator - Silvio Junior Mobile Development 2 - Lab 1

Welcome to the Interactive Physics Simulator, a dynamic web application designed to offer an engaging learning experience through physics-based simulations. This project utilizes JavaScript and the Matter.js physics engine to create an interactive environment where users can observe and manipulate objects to learn about physics concepts like gravity, collisions, and motion.

## Project Overview

The Interactive Physics Simulator aims to make learning physics concepts intuitive and fun. By interacting with various objects within a simulated environment, users can explore the principles of physics in real-time. The application features customizable objects, boundary conditions, and physics parameters to facilitate a wide range of experiments.

## Features

- **Dynamic Physics Simulations**: Utilize Matter.js to simulate real-world physics interactions within the browser.
- **Interactive Objects**: Create and manipulate objects with different physical properties and observe how they interact with each other and the environment.
- **Customizable Environment**: Adjust the simulation parameters such as gravity, friction, and air resistance to see how they affect the objects' behavior.

## Installation

To get started with the Interactive Physics Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjrsantos/Fanshawe_Projects/tree/main/Mobile_Development2/Week%204/SilvioJr-Mob2-Lab1
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd SilvioJr-Mob2-Lab1
```

3. Install the required npm packages.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the web interface. Use the controls provided to add objects to the simulation, change their properties, and adjust the environmental parameters. Experiment with different settings to learn how various physics concepts affect the objects.
