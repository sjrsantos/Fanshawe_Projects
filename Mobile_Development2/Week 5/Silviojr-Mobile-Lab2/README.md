# Silvio Mobile Development 2 - Lab 2

This project is an engaging interactive application developed using JavaScript and Matter.js, showcasing physics-based animations and interactions. It's designed to demonstrate the principles of physics in a fun and interactive way, allowing users to explore the effects of gravity, collision, and movement on different objects within a confined space.

## Project Overview

The application features a variety of physics-based functionalities, including object collision detection, dynamic movement controls, and automatic physical responses like bouncing or stopping upon collision. Utilizing Matter.js, a popular physics engine for the web, this project offers a hands-on experience with the basics of game physics and interactive animations.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Object Interaction**: Users can control a square object, navigating it around the screen to interact with other objects and boundaries.
- **Collision Detection and Response**: The project includes collision detection between objects, with visual feedback and physical responses like changing colors and stopping movement.
- **Physics Engine Integration**: Leveraging Matter.js for realistic physics simulations, including gravity, velocity, and friction effects on objects.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required npm packages by running `npm install`.
4. Start the application with `npm start`, which will open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

Interact with the application through keyboard inputs or touch (for mobile devices) to move the square object across the screen. Experiment with different movements to see how objects react to each other and the boundaries within the application space.
